# Neural Networks Examples Repository

This repository contains examples of various types of neural networks, including basic feedforward neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. These examples are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks and are designed to help you understand and implement different neural network architectures.

## Notebook

1. **Basic Neural Networks**: Introduction to simple feedforward neural networks using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Examples of CNNs applied to image classification tasks.
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Examples of RNNs applied to sequence data and time series forecasting.
4. **Transformers**: Examples of Transformer models applied to natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch
- Transformers library from Hugging Face
- Additional libraries as specified in each notebook

### Datasets
